# handbrake-converter
# Usage:
# Running the script without any parameters just uses *all* files in the
# ToBeConverted directory and converts them, so make sure you only have video files
# in that directory.
#
# You can specify an input and output directory if you want:
# 'script <INPUT> <OUTPUT>'
