# Title: handbrake-converter
## Usage:
Running the script without any parameters just uses *all* files in the
ToBeConverted directory and converts them and stores them in the Coverted directory,
so make sure you only have video files, in that directory.


#### Mac OSX
```
/usr/local/bin/handbrake-converter
```

#### Linux
```
/usr/local/bin/handbrake-converter
```
